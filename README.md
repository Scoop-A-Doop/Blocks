# Blocks
Blocks is a simple mood tracker for your day-to-day life. Inspired by _Pixels Journal - Mental Health_ by Teo Vogel, this version runs on your web browser and contains a few additional features. 

Blocks is hosted via AWS and Nginx and can be accessed here: http://ec2-100-26-230-149.compute-1.amazonaws.com/project.html

**How To Use**
Upon opening the website, you can navigate through the grid to find the current date. Upon finding the current date, you are able to select one of the 5 default moods to summarize your overall mood for the day. You can also create custom moods to use for your grid and you can delete them if you'd like. After updating your grid, you must export the grid data via the export button which saves all colored "blocks" and custom moods. When you'd like to make additional changes, import the exported text file and make whatever changes you would like, then export your grid data again.
